The project aims to incrementally implement a security extension for the Zenoh protocol.

The `src/bin/*.rs` files contain implementations of primitive functionalities, focusing first on communication and then on securing it.

Implementations are currently in progress and might be testing Zenoh rather than implementing the actual security extension.

In the [docs/](docs/index.md) folder, you can find more documentation of the project and its roadmap.
