AnonCreds
=========
AnonCreds is a project that aims to provide a way to issue and verify credentials in a privacy-preserving way. It is part of the Hyperledger project.

Looking at Hyperledger for proofs, I noticed this project that seems to align with what we were aiming for, with the verifiable data registry that can be the blockchain, the holder which would be each client, and the verifier the clients with whom it communicates: https://hyperledger.github.io/anoncreds-spec/#introduction - so it would be the one who initiates the communication to present the proof that they can do it, and the one who receives it to verify it
