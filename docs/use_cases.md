Router live configuration
=========================
Operating admin space operations on a router, only admitted to identified nodes with correct permissions.
* Granular read-only
* Full read-only
* Granular write
* Full write

This involves p2p communication between the router and the node.

Sensitive data publishing
=========================
Publishing sensitive data to a decentralized network, only admitted to be received by identified nodes with correct permissions.

This is a broadcast operation from the node, no key-exchange is involved, and publishing n-times the same data once per identified node is not advisable.
